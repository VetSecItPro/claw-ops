# /brainstorm — Socratic Design Exploration

**Steel Principle: NO implementation code until the design is user-approved and the spec is written.**

This skill turns vague ideas into validated, implementable designs BEFORE a single line of code is written. It's lighter than `/mdmp` (no military-style 6-lens analysis) but still enforces the discipline that separates "threw something together" from "designed something properly."

**FIRE AND FORGET** — Describe the idea. The skill asks one question at a time, explores 2-3 approaches, and produces an approved spec ready for `/subagent-dev`.

> **When to use /brainstorm:**
> - "I'm thinking about adding X"
> - "Should we refactor Y?"
> - "I have an idea..."
> - "What if we tried Z?"
> - Exploring a feature that isn't fully formed yet
>
> **When to use /mdmp instead:**
> - Multi-lens analysis needed (security, DevOps, product, QA all matter)
> - Architectural change with organizational impact
> - Multiple stakeholders' concerns must be weighed
>
> **When NOT to use /brainstorm:**
> - Bug fix → `/investigate`
> - Already-designed feature → `/subagent-dev`
> - Quick change you already know the answer to → just do it

## DISCIPLINE

> Reference: [Superpowers Discipline Protocol](~/.claude/standards/STEEL_DISCIPLINE.md)

Key enforcements for this skill:

- **Steel Principle #4:** NO implementation before approved design (the HARD-GATE)
- **Steel Principle #5:** NO placeholders in the final spec (specific, actionable, complete)
- **One question at a time** - no bundled questions, no overwhelming the user
- **Explore, don't dictate** - present 2-3 approaches with tradeoffs, let user decide

### Brainstorm-Specific Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Reality | What to Do |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| "This is simple, we can skip the spec" | Simple ideas with wrong assumptions build the wrong thing faster | Write the spec. Even 10 lines of spec beats 100 lines of wrong code. |
| "I already know what the user wants" | You know what they said. You don't know what they MEANT. | Ask the clarifying question. |
| "Let's just start coding and iterate" | You'll iterate, but on the wrong foundation | The foundation is the spec. Get it right first. |
| "The user is impatient, skip questions" | Impatience leads to rework. Rework is slower than asking. | One focused question, then proceed. |
| "I can infer the edge cases" | You can infer SOME edge cases. Users know edge cases you can't see. | Ask about the tricky ones. |

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

```
.brainstorm-reports/
├── BRAIN-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md      # Brainstorm session report
├── state-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json    # State (for resume)
docs/brainstorm/specs/
└── YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-design.md  # The approved spec (committed to repo)
```

The report lives in `.brainstorm-reports/` (gitignored). The spec lives in `docs/brainstorm/specs/` and is committed - it's the permanent record.

---

## PHASE 0: INTAKE

Parse the user's request:
- **Topic:** What are they thinking about?
- **Signal strength:** Clear goal, rough idea, or just exploring?
- **Affected area:** Which part of the codebase? (may need to ask)

### 0.1 Create Infrastructure

```bash
mkdir -p .brainstorm-reports docs/brainstorm/specs
grep -q ".brainstorm-reports" .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo ".brainstorm-reports/" >> .gitignore
```

### 0.2 Announce

```
I'm using /brainstorm to explore this properly before we write code.
I'll ask one focused question at a time, then present 2-3 approaches.
No code until you approve the spec.
```

---

## PHASE 1: CONTEXT EXPLORATION

**Before asking the user anything, explore the codebase.** This is silent prep - don't bombard the user with questions you could answer yourself.

### 1.1 Read What Exists

- Relevant directories (`src/components/`, `src/app/api/`, wherever the topic lives)
- Recent commits in the affected area (`git log --oneline -10 -- [paths]`)
- CLAUDE.md for any project-specific rules
- Package.json for framework, dependencies
- Any existing specs in `docs/brainstorm/specs/`

### 1.2 Identify Unknowns

Write a private list of what you DON'T know yet:
- Exact user needs (what "good" looks like from their perspective)
- Constraints (budget, timeline, existing contracts)
- Hidden requirements (mobile? offline? real-time?)
- Integration points (other systems, other features)

The next phase asks about these.

---

## PHASE 2: CLARIFYING QUESTIONS

**Ask ONE question at a time.** Never bundle. Never present 5 questions at once.

### Question Priority Order

1. **Goal question first:** What problem does this solve? What does success look like?
2. **Scope question:** MVP vs. full? What's the minimum viable version?
3. **User question:** Who will use this? How often? What's their context?
4. **Constraint questions:** Deadline? Budget? Existing patterns to follow?
5. **Edge case questions:** What about [specific tricky scenario]?
6. **Integration questions:** How does this interact with [other feature]?

### Question Format

**Multiple choice preferred** when the options are bounded:
```
What should happen when a user deletes their account?

A) Hard delete - remove all data immediately
B) Soft delete - flag as deleted, purge after 30 days
C) Anonymize - keep data but remove PII

(If something else, describe it.)
```

**Open-ended** when options aren't known:
```
Walk me through a typical use case. Who does what, in what order?
```

### Stopping Rule

Stop asking questions when:
- You have enough to propose 2-3 distinct approaches
- Further questions would be about implementation details (save those for the spec)
- The user seems impatient or says "just propose something"

**Maximum 5 clarifying questions** before moving to Phase 3. If you need more, you're exploring something too big for `/brainstorm` - suggest escalating to `/mdmp`.

---

## PHASE 3: APPROACH EXPLORATION

Present 2-3 distinct approaches. Not 2-3 variants of the same approach - genuinely different paths.

### Approach Format

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
APPROACH [LETTER]: [Short Name]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Core idea:** [One sentence]

**How it works:**
- [Step or component 1]
- [Step or component 2]
- [Step or component 3]

**Pros:**
- [Specific advantage 1]
- [Specific advantage 2]

**Cons:**
- [Specific tradeoff 1]
- [Specific tradeoff 2]

**Best for:** [When this approach wins]
**Effort:** [Low / Medium / High - relative to other approaches]
**Risk:** [Specific risk or "Low"]
```

### Recommendation

After presenting approaches, recommend ONE:

```
**Recommendation:** Approach [X]

**Why:** [2-3 sentences tying recommendation to what the user said they cared about]

**When to pick a different one:**
- Pick A if [condition]
- Pick B if [condition]
```

### User Decision Point

Wait for the user to pick. DON'T proceed to spec writing until they confirm.

If they want to modify an approach (hybrid), capture the modification and proceed.

---

## PHASE 4: SPEC WRITING

Once the approach is approved, write the spec.

### Spec Template

```markdown
# Design Spec: [Topic Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Approach:** [Letter and Name]
**Status:** APPROVED / DRAFT / REVISION_NEEDED

---

## Problem

[What problem does this solve? Why now?]

## Goal

[What does success look like? Measurable if possible.]

## Non-Goals

[What this explicitly is NOT trying to solve. Prevents scope creep.]

## Approach

[The approved approach in detail - 2-4 paragraphs]

## Architecture

### Components to Create

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| [Name] | `src/.../` | [One-line purpose] |

### Components to Modify

| File | What Changes | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| `src/.../file.ts` | [Specific change] | [Reason] |

### Data Model

```typescript
// Types/schemas involved
interface [Name] {
  [field]: [type]; // [purpose]
}
```

### API (if applicable)

| Endpoint | Method | Input | Output |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| `/api/...` | GET | [schema] | [schema] |

## User Flow

1. User does [action]
2. System responds with [behavior]
3. [Continue step by step]

## Edge Cases

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| [Tricky scenario 1] | [What happens] |
| [Tricky scenario 2] | [What happens] |

## Constraints

- [Constraint 1 - e.g., "Must work without JS for form submission"]
- [Constraint 2 - e.g., "No new dependencies"]

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for [specific modules]
- Integration tests for [specific flows]
- E2E test for [critical path]

## Rollout

- [How to ship safely - feature flag? Phased? All at once?]

## Out of Scope (Revisit Later)

- [Feature/concern deliberately excluded and why]

## Open Questions

[Only if genuinely unresolved. Empty is ideal.]

---

## Implementation Handoff

Ready for `/subagent-dev [path to this spec]` to execute.
```

### Self-Review (before presenting)

Before showing the spec to the user, check:

1. **Placeholder scan:** Grep the spec for "TBD", "TODO", "...", "similar to", "etc." - if any exist, fill them in
2. **Internal consistency:** Are the Architecture, User Flow, and Edge Cases consistent?
3. **Completeness:** Could a developer build this from the spec alone without asking questions?
4. **Scope check:** Does every section trace back to the approved approach? No scope creep.

### Present to User

```
📝 Spec written: docs/brainstorm/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-design.md

Quick read:
- Problem: [one line]
- Approach: [one line]
- Scope: [count] components, [count] files modified

**Review the full spec.** When approved, we're ready for /subagent-dev.

Want changes? Describe what to adjust.
```

---

## PHASE 5: HARD-GATE (USER APPROVAL)

**ABSOLUTE RULE:** No implementation code until the user explicitly approves the spec.

```
🚧 HARD-GATE: Waiting for spec approval

Options:
- "Approve" / "Looks good" / "Let's build it" → Proceed to /subagent-dev
- "Change X" → Revise spec, re-present
- "Need more exploration on Y" → Return to Phase 2/3 for that aspect
```

DO NOT:
- Start writing implementation code
- Propose implementation "just to be helpful"
- Bypass the gate for "simple" specs

DO:
- Wait patiently for approval
- Accept revisions gracefully
- Iterate on the spec as needed

---

## PHASE 6: HANDOFF

Once approved:

```
✅ Spec approved.

Handoff options:
1. /subagent-dev docs/brainstorm/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-design.md
   → Automated execution with two-stage review per task

2. I can execute inline (I'll follow the spec step by step)
   → Best for small specs, < 5 tasks

3. You want to build it yourself
   → Spec is ready, happy building

Which do you prefer?
```

---

## CLEANUP PROTOCOL

> Reference: [Resource Cleanup Protocol](~/.claude/standards/CLEANUP_PROTOCOL.md)

### Brainstorm-Specific Cleanup

1. **Preserve the spec** - `docs/brainstorm/specs/*` stays (committed to repo)
2. **State file** - keep for 24h in case user wants to resume, then auto-clean
3. **No test data created** - nothing to delete
4. **No servers/browsers opened** - nothing to close

---

## SITREP

> Reference: [SITREP Standard](~/.claude/standards/SITREP_FORMAT.md)

```markdown
## SITREP - /brainstorm

**Topic:** [user's topic]
**Duration:** [X minutes, Y questions asked]
**Approaches explored:** [count]
**Selected approach:** [name]
**Status:** SPEC_APPROVED / AWAITING_APPROVAL / ABANDONED

### What Was Produced
- Spec: `docs/brainstorm/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-design.md`
- Length: [X] sections, [Y] tasks implied

### Clarifying Questions Asked
1. [question] → [answer, 1 line]
2. [question] → [answer, 1 line]

### Approaches Considered
| Letter | Name | Verdict |
|--------|------|---------|
| A | [name] | [chosen/rejected because X] |
| B | [name] | [chosen/rejected because X] |

### Next Steps
- `/subagent-dev [spec path]` to implement with automated review
```

## RELATED SKILLS

**Feeds from:**
- (none - /brainstorm is typically the starting point for new ideas)

**Feeds into:**
- `/subagent-dev` - the approved spec from Phase 5 is the direct input; handoff is explicit at Phase 6
- `/mdmp` - if the scope grows beyond brainstorm capacity (multi-team, architectural), escalate here
- `/write-skill` - if the brainstorm subject is a new skill to create, hand off the spec there

**Pairs with:**
- `/design` - pair brainstorm output with a design pass when the feature has significant UI impact
- `/docs` - write ADR entries to capture the design decision after spec is approved

**Auto-suggest after completion:**
When this skill finishes with an approved spec, suggest: `/subagent-dev [spec path]` to execute the plan with automated two-stage review

---

## REMEMBER

- **One question at a time** - never bundle
- **Explore before deciding** - 2-3 genuine alternatives, not variants
- **HARD-GATE is absolute** - no code before approval, no exceptions
- **No placeholders in the spec** - specific, actionable, complete
- **The spec is the contract** - between planning and execution
- **Escalate to /mdmp** if the topic grows beyond brainstorm scope (architectural, multi-team, multi-concern)
