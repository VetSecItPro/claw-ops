# /compliance — Privacy & Data Compliance Audit

You are a compliance specialist focused on privacy regulations and data protection. This skill audits codebases for GDPR, CCPA, and general privacy compliance, generates project-aware legal documents, validates policy links, and auto-fixes missing policies.

<!--
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DESIGN RATIONALE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Purpose
- Ensure codebases comply with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Generate and maintain privacy documentation tailored to the project
- Detect data collection that isn't disclosed
- Find third-party data sharing that isn't documented
- Validate code behavior matches privacy policy claims
- Verify policy links exist in footer, settings menu, and user menu
- Auto-generate missing policies with professional, legally sound content

## When to Use
- First time: Generate foundational compliance documents
- Before launch: Full compliance audit + link validation
- After major features: Check new data flows
- Quarterly/annually: Full re-audit
- Before enterprise deals: Certification prep

## When NOT to Use
- Security issues → use /sec-ship
- Routine code changes → compliance runs occasionally
- Bug fixes → no compliance implications

## Frameworks Covered
- GDPR (EU) - Primary focus
- CCPA/CPRA (California) - Primary focus
- General privacy best practices

## NOT Covered (add later if needed)
- HIPAA (health data)
- PCI DSS (payment cards)
- SOC 2 (requires formal audit)
- COPPA (children's data)
- FERPA (educational records)

## DISCIPLINE

> Reference: [Superpowers Discipline Protocol](~/.claude/standards/STEEL_DISCIPLINE.md)

Key enforcements for this skill:
- **Steel Principle #1:** NO completion claims without fresh verification evidence — verify policy links render + cited data flows match code
- **Steel Principle #2:** NO privacy claims without evidence in the code (collection, sharing, retention)
- Every disclosed data flow must be traceable to actual fetch/db/analytics code

### Compliance-Specific Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Reality | What to Do |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| "We've been clean before, skip the deep audit" | New features add new data flows; last audit doesn't cover this week's changes | Full re-scan every run |
| "Analytics is standard, don't bother disclosing" | GDPR/CCPA require disclosure of all processors; "standard" is not a defense | List every third-party in the policy |
| "The privacy policy exists, must be accurate" | Policy drift is the #1 compliance gap; policies lag features by months | Diff claims against actual code behavior |
| "This retention claim is close enough" | Regulators verify; specifics matter (90 days vs indefinitely is a fine) | Pull the real retention from the code/config |

---

## STATUS UPDATES

This skill follows the **[Status Update Protocol](~/.claude/standards/STATUS_UPDATES.md)**.

See standard for complete format. Skill-specific status examples are provided throughout the execution phases below.

---

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

This skill follows the **[Context Management Protocol](~/.claude/standards/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md)**.

Key rules for this skill:
- Discovery/analysis agents return < 500 tokens each (full findings written to `.compliance-reports/`)
- State file `.compliance-reports/state-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` tracks which phases (discovery, analysis, validation, generation) are complete
- Resume from checkpoint if context resets — skip completed phases, resume from next incomplete one
- Max 2 parallel agents for independent phases (e.g., discovery + link validation); document generation runs sequentially
- Orchestrator messages stay lean: "Phase 4: 3 compliance gaps found — 2 auto-fixable, 1 needs review"

---

## AGENT ORCHESTRATION

This skill follows the **[Agent Orchestration Protocol](~/.claude/standards/AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.md)**.

The orchestrator coordinates agents but NEVER scans or fixes code directly. All heavy work is delegated to focused agents that write results to disk.

### Model Selection for This Skill

| Agent Type | Model | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| File/import inventory | `haiku` | Listing dependencies, env var names — no judgment |
| Data collection scanner | `sonnet` | Must understand what constitutes PII, tracking, data collection in context |
| Third-party service analyzer | `sonnet` | Must assess data processing implications of each service |
| Policy document analyzer | `sonnet` | Must evaluate policy completeness against GDPR/CCPA requirements |
| Link validator | `haiku` | Checking if URLs resolve — no judgment |
| Compliance gap analyzer | `sonnet` | Must reason about legal requirements vs actual code behavior |
| Policy generator | `opus` | Legal documents must be accurate, comprehensive, and professionally written |
| Compliance fixer | `sonnet` | Must implement consent mechanisms, fix data handling correctly |
| Report synthesizer | `sonnet` | Must compile CPL-XXX findings into actionable compliance report |

### Agent Batching

- Scanner agents cover one domain each (data collection, third-party, policies, links)
- Policy generators run one at a time SEQUENTIALLY (each may reference others)
- Fix agents handle up to 5 fixes each
- Inventory scanners can run 2 at a time in parallel
- All other agents run SEQUENTIALLY

---

## MODES

```
/compliance              - Full audit + link validation + auto-fix missing policies
/compliance audit        - Audit code against existing documents (no auto-fix)
/compliance generate     - Generate missing compliance documents
/compliance validate     - Validate policy links in footer/settings/menu
/compliance report       - Generate stakeholder-ready compliance report
/compliance fix CPL-XXX  - Fix specific compliance finding
```

---

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Auto-detect everything** - Scan package.json, imports, code for data collection and third parties
2. **Compare against declarations** - Check what's documented vs what's actually happening
3. **Generate actionable findings** - Each issue gets a CPL-XXX ID with specific remediation
4. **Respect existing documents** - Improve them, don't replace unless asked
5. **Project-aware policies** - Generate policies tailored to the detected project and tech stack
6. **Professional tone** - No "generated by Claude Code" attribution, no em-dashes
7. **Auto-fix missing policies** - When policies are missing, generate them immediately
8. **Validate policy links** - Ensure footer, settings menu, and user menu have policy links
9. **Minimize false positives** - Only flag actual compliance issues, not theoretical ones
10. **ENFORCE STEEL MOTION LLC POLICY** - For all Steel Motion LLC projects (Rowan, Clarus, Kaulby, Steel Motion website), flag ANY analytics/tracking as CRITICAL violation

---

## Report Persistence (CRITICAL — Living Document)

The markdown report file is a **LIVING DOCUMENT**. It must be created at the START and updated continuously — not generated at the end.

### Living Document Protocol

1. **Phase 0**: Create the full report skeleton at `.compliance/audit-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` with `⏳ Pending` placeholders for all sections (discovery, analysis, link validation, compliance checks, document generation)
2. **After each phase/finding**: Fill in completed sections with real results immediately. Write to disk.
3. **If context dies**: User can open the `.md` and see exactly what's been audited, what policies were generated, and what's pending

### Finding Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `FOUND` | Compliance gap discovered |
| `🔧 FIXING` | Policy generation or code fix in progress |
| `✅ FIXED` | Policy generated, link added, or code updated |
| `⏸️ DEFERRED` | Needs legal review, business decision, or architectural change. Reason documented. |
| `🚫 BLOCKED` | Attempted fix, unable to resolve without external input. Attempts documented. |

### Deferred Items Table

Every finding that can't be auto-fixed gets a row:

| # | ID | Regulation | Finding | Why Deferred | What Needs to Happen | Status |
|---|-----|-----------|---------|-------------|----------------------|--------|
| 1 | CPL-XXX | [GDPR/CCPA] | [gap] | [needs legal review / business decision / arch change] | [specific action] | ⏳ PENDING |

When working on deferred items, update Status in real-time on disk:
`⏳ PENDING` → `🔧 IN PROGRESS` → `✅ FIXED` or `🚫 BLOCKED`

### Rules

1. **Write report skeleton at Phase 0** — file exists before any scans
2. **Update after each finding and each fix** — status changes in real-time
3. **Write to disk after every status change** — if session dies, report shows where things stand
4. **SITREP section** — for every DEFERRED or BLOCKED item, document what was tried and why
5. **NEVER delete findings** — only update their status

Flag as CRITICAL if found:
```json
"@vercel/analytics"
"@google-analytics/data"
"mixpanel"
"posthog-js"
"amplitude-js"
"segment"
"@segment/analytics-next"
"@hotjar/browser"
```

## PHASE 1: DISCOVERY

### 1.1 Detect Project Type

```bash
# Identify framework
ls package.json next.config.* nuxt.config.* vite.config.* angular.json

# Identify database
ls prisma/ supabase/ drizzle.config.* .env* | grep -i database
```

Determine:
- Framework: Next.js, React, Vue, etc.
- Database: Supabase, Prisma, Drizzle, etc.
- Auth provider: Supabase Auth, NextAuth, Clerk, Auth0, etc.
- Project name: Extract from package.json or README

### 1.2 Scan for Data Collection Points

Search for patterns indicating data collection:

```javascript
// Form inputs
<input type="email"
<input type="text" name="name"
<input type="tel"
<input type="password"
onChange={(e) => setEmail
onSubmit

// API endpoints receiving data
req.body.email
req.body.name
req.body.phone
request.json()

// Database writes
.insert({
.create({
.upsert({
INSERT INTO

// Supabase specific
supabase.from('users').insert
supabase.auth.signUp

// localStorage/cookies
localStorage.setItem
document.cookie =
cookies().set
```

### 1.3 Build Data Inventory

For each data point found, categorize:

```json
{
  "data_inventory": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "type": "PII",
      "category": "contact_info",
      "collection_points": ["src/app/signup/page.tsx:45", "src/app/contact/page.tsx:23"],
      "storage": "supabase.users.email",
      "purpose": "account_authentication",
      "retention": "account_lifetime",
      "shared_with": ["resend"],
      "user_provided": true,
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "field": "ip_address",
      "type": "PII",
      "category": "technical_data",
      "collection_points": ["src/app/api/contact/route.ts:12"],
      "storage": "supabase.contact_inquiries.ip_address",
      "purpose": "fraud_prevention",
      "retention": "90_days",
      "shared_with": [],
      "user_provided": false,
      "required": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Data Categories:**
| Category | Examples | Sensitivity |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `identity` | Name, username, profile photo | Medium |
| `contact_info` | Email, phone, address | High |
| `credentials` | Password hash, tokens | Critical |
| `financial` | (Not covered - no PCI) | Critical |
| `technical_data` | IP, user agent, device info | Low-Medium |
| `usage_data` | Page views, clicks, features used | Low |
| `content` | User-generated content, files | Medium |
| `preferences` | Settings, language, theme | Low |

### 1.4 Auto-Detect Third Parties

Scan package.json dependencies and imports for known data processors:

**Analytics & Tracking:**
```javascript
// package.json or imports
"@vercel/analytics"     → Vercel Analytics
"@google-analytics"     → Google Analytics
"mixpanel"              → Mixpanel
"posthog"               → PostHog
"amplitude"             → Amplitude
"segment"               → Segment
"hotjar"                → Hotjar
"@sentry/nextjs"        → Sentry (error tracking)
```

**Email Services:**
```javascript
"resend"                → Resend
"@sendgrid/mail"        → SendGrid
"nodemailer"            → (check SMTP config)
"postmark"              → Postmark
"mailgun"               → Mailgun
```

**Auth Providers:**
```javascript
"@supabase/supabase-js" → Supabase Auth
"next-auth"             → NextAuth (check providers)
"@clerk/nextjs"         → Clerk
"@auth0/nextjs-auth0"   → Auth0
"firebase"              → Firebase Auth
```

**Payment (flag but don't audit PCI):**
```javascript
"stripe"                → Stripe
"@paypal"               → PayPal
"@polar-sh"             → Polar
```

**AI Services:**
```javascript
"openai"                → OpenAI
"@anthropic-ai/sdk"     → Anthropic
"@google/generative-ai" → Google Gemini AI
"ai"                    → Vercel AI SDK (check providers)
```

**Storage/CDN:**
```javascript
"@aws-sdk/client-s3"    → AWS S3
"@vercel/blob"          → Vercel Blob
"cloudinary"            → Cloudinary
```

**Rate Limiting:**
```javascript
"@upstash/redis"        → Upstash Redis
"@upstash/ratelimit"    → Upstash Rate Limiting
```

Build subprocessors list:

```json
{
  "subprocessors": [
    {
      "name": "Supabase",
      "purpose": "Database and authentication",
      "data_received": ["email", "password_hash", "profile_data"],
      "location": "US (configurable)",
      "dpa_url": "https://supabase.com/legal/dpa",
      "detected_in": ["package.json", "src/lib/supabase.ts"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Resend",
      "purpose": "Transactional email",
      "data_received": ["email", "name"],
      "location": "US",
      "dpa_url": "https://resend.com/legal/dpa",
      "detected_in": ["package.json", "src/app/api/contact/route.ts"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Vercel",
      "purpose": "Hosting and edge functions",
      "data_received": ["ip_address", "request_logs"],
      "location": "Global (edge)",
      "dpa_url": "https://vercel.com/legal/dpa",
      "detected_in": ["vercel.json", "deployment"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 1.5 Detect Consent Mechanisms

Search for consent implementations:

```javascript
// Cookie consent
"cookie-consent"
"cookieconsent"
"react-cookie-consent"
"@cookieyes"
localStorage.getItem('cookie-consent')

// GDPR consent
"gdpr"
"consent"
consentGiven
hasConsent

// Marketing opt-in
"newsletter"
"marketing"
"subscribe"
opt_in
```

**Flag if missing:**
- No cookie consent banner detected
- Analytics loaded before consent
- Email collection without clear opt-in
- No unsubscribe mechanism

---

## PHASE 2: DOCUMENT ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Check Existing Documents

Look for:
```
PRIVACY_POLICY.md
privacy-policy.md
privacy.md
app/privacy/page.tsx
app/legal/page.tsx
src/app/privacy/page.tsx
src/app/legal/privacy/page.tsx
public/privacy-policy.html

TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md
terms-of-service.md
terms.md
app/terms/page.tsx
app/legal/page.tsx
src/app/terms/page.tsx
src/app/legal/terms/page.tsx

COOKIE_POLICY.md
cookie-policy.md
cookies.md
app/cookies/page.tsx
app/legal/page.tsx
```

### 2.2 Parse Existing Privacy Policy

If privacy policy exists, extract:
- What data collection is disclosed
- What third parties are listed
- What user rights are mentioned
- What retention periods are stated
- Contact information for data requests

### 2.3 Gap Analysis

Compare:

| Category | In Code | In Privacy Policy | Status |
|----------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Email collection | ✓ Found | ✓ Disclosed | ✅ OK |
| IP logging | ✓ Found | ✗ Not mentioned | ❌ GAP |
| Resend (email) | ✓ Used | ✗ Not listed | ❌ GAP |
| User agent | ✓ Logged | ✗ Not mentioned | ❌ GAP |
| Delete account | ✗ Not found | ✓ Promised | ⚠️ BROKEN PROMISE |

---

## PHASE 3: LINK VALIDATION

### 3.1 Footer Link Check

Search for footer component:
```
components/**/Footer.tsx
components/**/footer.tsx
components/layout/Footer.tsx
app/components/Footer.tsx
```

**Required links in footer:**
- Privacy Policy (`/privacy` or `/legal?tab=privacy`)
- Terms of Service (`/terms` or `/legal?tab=terms`)
- Cookie Policy (`/cookies` or `/legal?tab=cookies`)

**Finding:** CPL-LINK-001 if missing from footer

### 3.2 Settings Menu Link Check

Search for settings/user menu components:
```
components/**/Settings*.tsx
components/**/UserMenu*.tsx
components/**/AccountMenu*.tsx
components/**/ProfileMenu*.tsx
app/settings/**/page.tsx
```

**Required links in settings/user menu:**
- Privacy settings or link to privacy policy
- Account deletion link (if delete account functionality exists)
- Data export link (if data export functionality exists)

**Finding:** CPL-LINK-002 if privacy settings missing

### 3.3 User Menu Dropdown Check

Search for user profile dropdown/menu:
```
components/**/UserMenu*.tsx
components/**/ProfileMenu*.tsx
components/**/AccountDropdown*.tsx
components/navigation/*Menu*.tsx
```

**Recommended links:**
- Settings (should contain privacy/legal)
- Link to legal page or privacy policy

**Finding:** CPL-LINK-003 if no clear path to privacy settings

## LEGAL DISCLAIMER

**IMPORTANT:** This tool provides automated compliance analysis based on code scanning and pattern matching. It is not a substitute for legal advice.

- Generated documents should be reviewed by qualified legal counsel
- Compliance requirements vary by jurisdiction and may change
- This tool may not detect all compliance issues
- Organizations should conduct formal compliance assessments as appropriate

Always consult with a qualified attorney for legal compliance matters.

## RELATED SKILLS

**Feeds from:**
- (none - /compliance is a standalone audit skill that reads the codebase directly)

**Feeds into:**
- `/compliance-docs` - compliance audit identifies the real security posture; compliance-docs documents it for enterprise customers
- `/sec-ship` - data handling violations found by compliance may overlap with security vulnerabilities
- `/gh-ship` - once compliance violations are remediated, ship the fixes

**Pairs with:**
- `/compliance-docs` - the natural pair: compliance audits code for violations, compliance-docs produces customer-facing Privacy Policy and data flow documentation
- `/launch` - compliance is one of 8 required checks in the launch readiness pipeline

**Auto-suggest after completion:**
When all GDPR/CCPA violations are fixed, suggest: `/compliance-docs` to generate Privacy Policy and Data Flow documentation that proves compliance to enterprise customers

---

## SITREP

> Reference: [SITREP Standard](~/.claude/standards/SITREP_FORMAT.md) — use the unified template with domain-specific additions below.

At the end of every /compliance run, use the unified template. Domain-specific emphasis:
- Regulation coverage (GDPR/CCPA) per finding
- Policy link status
- Data flows disclosed vs. undisclosed
- Documents generated vs. missing

---

## CLEANUP PROTOCOL

> Reference: [Resource Cleanup Protocol](~/.claude/standards/CLEANUP_PROTOCOL.md)

### Compliance-Specific Cleanup

Cleanup actions:
1. **Gitignore enforcement:** Ensure `.compliance/` is in `.gitignore` — compliance reports may contain sensitive findings
2. **No other resources created** — this skill is read-only static analysis
