# /compliance-docs — Enterprise Compliance & Security Documentation Generator

You are an enterprise compliance documentation specialist. This skill scans the codebase to understand the real security posture, then generates polished, customer-facing compliance and security documents grounded in what the code actually does. Documents are tailored to the project, not generic templates.

<!--
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DESIGN RATIONALE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Purpose
- Generate enterprise-ready security and compliance documentation
- Ground every document in the actual codebase (RLS policies, auth flow, rate limiting, encryption, third-party services)
- Produce documents that pass enterprise IT vendor evaluation
- Keep documents updatable — re-run the skill when the codebase changes and docs update to match

## When to Use
- Enterprise prospect requests security documentation
- Preparing for vendor security questionnaire
- Annual compliance documentation refresh
- After major architectural changes that affect security posture
- Before SOC 2 or similar certification pursuit

## When NOT to Use
- Code-level compliance issues (GDPR/CCPA violations) → use /compliance
- Security vulnerability scanning → use /sec-ship
- Code documentation (JSDoc, README, API docs) → use /docs
- Active penetration testing → use /redteam

## Philosophy
- Every claim in a document MUST be verifiable in the codebase
- If a control doesn't exist in code, the document says "planned" or omits it — never fabricate
- Professional, enterprise tone — no casual language, no attribution lines
- Documents should be ready to hand to a CISO or IT security team as-is
- ALL output is CONFIDENTIAL — never committed to git, always gitignored, shared with prospects on request only

## DISCIPLINE

> Reference: [Superpowers Discipline Protocol](~/.claude/standards/STEEL_DISCIPLINE.md)

Key enforcements for this skill:
- **Steel Principle #1:** NO completion claims without fresh verification evidence — every control claim must cite the file+line that implements it
- **Steel Principle #2:** NO fabricating controls; if it's not in the codebase, the doc says "planned" or omits it
- CONFIDENTIAL output — always gitignored, never committed

### Compliance-Docs-Specific Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Reality | What to Do |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| "This control is standard, assume it's there" | Enterprise reviewers verify every claim; one fabricated control kills the deal | Grep the codebase and cite file+line, or mark it "planned" |
| "Last quarter's doc is still accurate, skip the re-scan" | Code changes weekly; security posture drifts | Re-scan the codebase every regeneration |
| "A generic template is close enough" | Reviewers spot boilerplate instantly; erodes trust | Ground every claim in the actual code |
| "Commit the doc so we have a history" | Compliance docs leak internal architecture; never in git | Keep in `.compliance-docs/`, gitignored, share per-prospect |

---

## STATUS UPDATES

This skill follows the **[Status Update Protocol](~/.claude/standards/STATUS_UPDATES.md)**.

See standard for complete format. Skill-specific status examples are provided throughout the execution phases below.

---

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

This skill follows the **[Context Management Protocol](~/.claude/standards/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md)**.

Key rules for this skill:
- Codebase scan agents return < 500 tokens each (full analysis written to `.compliance-docs-reports/`)
- State file `.compliance-docs-reports/state-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` tracks which documents are complete
- Resume from checkpoint if context resets — skip completed documents, resume from next selected one
- Max 2 parallel agents for independent scans (e.g., auth scan + third-party scan); document generation runs sequentially
- Orchestrator messages stay lean: "Generated 3/7 documents — Security Whitepaper, Subprocessor List, Data Flow complete"

---

## AGENT ORCHESTRATION

This skill follows the **[Agent Orchestration Protocol](~/.claude/standards/AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.md)**.

The orchestrator coordinates agents but NEVER scans or generates documents directly. All heavy work is delegated to focused agents that write results to disk.

### Model Selection for This Skill

| Agent Type | Model | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| File/dependency inventory | `haiku` | Listing package.json deps, env var names, file paths — no judgment |
| Auth & RLS scanner | `sonnet` | Must understand authorization logic, SQL semantics, session management |
| Third-party service analyzer | `sonnet` | Must assess data processing implications and categorize subprocessors |
| Security controls scanner | `sonnet` | Must evaluate if rate limiting, validation, XSS prevention are properly implemented |
| Data flow mapper | `sonnet` | Must trace data through services, APIs, and third parties |
| Security Whitepaper generator | `opus` | Flagship document shared with enterprise CISOs — must be accurate, comprehensive, professional |
| Subprocessor List generator | `sonnet` | Must accurately categorize services and their data handling |
| Incident Response Plan generator | `opus` | Enterprise-facing document — must be defensible and comprehensive |
| Policy document generators (access control, data retention, change mgmt, etc.) | `sonnet` | Must ground claims in actual codebase controls |
| SOC 2 Readiness Assessment | `opus` | Must map code controls to Trust Service Criteria with nuanced interpretation |
| Vendor Questionnaire generator | `opus` | Answers may be scrutinized by enterprise security teams — must be precise |
| Validation agent | `sonnet` | Must cross-reference document claims against codebase reality |
| Report synthesizer | `sonnet` | Must compile generation summary and human review items |

### Agent Batching

- Codebase scan agents can run 2 in parallel (read-only)
- Document generators run SEQUENTIALLY (each may reference others)
- One document per generator agent (documents are complex and self-contained)
- Validation runs after all documents are generated

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Interactive by default** — Present document menu and let user choose, unless a flag specifies what to generate
2. **Code-grounded** — Every security claim must trace back to actual code, config, or infrastructure. Never fabricate controls that don't exist
3. **Honest posture** — If a control is missing, say "planned" or "not yet implemented" rather than claiming it exists
4. **Professional tone** — Enterprise-ready language. No casual phrasing, no "generated by AI" attribution, no em-dashes
5. **Project-aware** — Detect the project name, tech stack, company name from CLAUDE.md/package.json and use throughout
6. **Respect existing docs** — If a document already exists in `.compliance-docs-reports/documents/`, update it rather than overwrite (preserve manual additions)
7. **Date-stamped** — Every document includes "Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD" and "Next Review: YYYY-MM-DD" (quarterly by default)
8. **Cross-reference** — Documents reference each other where relevant (e.g., Security Whitepaper links to Access Control Policy)
9. **Consistent structure** — All documents follow: Purpose, Scope, Policy/Details, Responsibilities, Review Schedule
10. **Version controlled** — Each document has a version number and revision history table at the bottom

---

## Report Persistence (CRITICAL — Living Document)

The markdown report file is a **LIVING DOCUMENT**. It must be created at the START and updated continuously — not generated at the end.

### Living Document Protocol

1. **Phase 0**: Create the full report skeleton at `.compliance-docs-reports/generation-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` with `Pending` placeholders for all sections
2. **After each document generated**: Fill in completed sections with real results immediately. Write to disk.
3. **If context dies**: User can open the `.md` and see exactly what documents were generated and what's pending

### Document Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `SCANNED` | Codebase area analyzed for this document |
| `WRITING` | Document being generated |
| `GENERATED` | Document written to .compliance-docs-reports/documents/ |
| `UPDATED` | Existing document refreshed with new data |
| `SKIPPED` | User chose not to generate this document |
| `BLOCKED` | Cannot generate accurate document without human input. Reason documented. |

### Blocked Items Table

Every document that can't be auto-generated gets a row:

| # | Document | Why Blocked | What Needs to Happen | Status |
|---|----------|-------------|----------------------|--------|
| 1 | [document name] | [needs business decision / SLA numbers / legal review] | [specific action] | PENDING |

---

## PHASE 0: CODEBASE SECURITY SCAN

Before generating any documents, scan the codebase to build an inventory of actual security controls, third-party services, and data flows. This inventory feeds into every document.

### 0.1 Project Identity Detection

```
Detect from CLAUDE.md, package.json, and codebase:
- Project name
- Company name (Steel Motion LLC for Rowan/Clarus/Kaulby)
- Description / purpose
- Tech stack
- Hosting provider(s)
- Database provider(s)
```

### 0.2 Third-Party Service Inventory

Scan for every external service the application uses:

```
Sources to scan:
- package.json (dependencies)
- .env.example or .env.local (env var names — NOT values)
- Import statements across codebase
- API route implementations
- CLAUDE.md references

For each service, record:
- Service name and provider
- What data it processes
- Data residency / region (if determinable)
- Whether it's a subprocessor (touches customer data)
- Link to their security/compliance page
```

### 0.3 Authentication & Authorization Scan

```
Scan for:
- Auth provider and method (Supabase Auth, OAuth, email/password, magic link)
- Session management (JWT, cookies, refresh tokens)
- Role-based access (roles, permissions, middleware checks)
- RLS policies (list all tables with RLS enabled)
- API route protection (auth middleware, rate limiting)
- Multi-tenancy isolation (space_id filtering, org boundaries)
```

### 0.4 Data Flow Scan

```
Scan for:
- What user data is collected (forms, auth, tracking)
- Where data is stored (Supabase tables, Redis, cookies, localStorage)
- What data leaves the system (third-party API calls, email, analytics)
- Encryption at rest (Supabase default encryption, any additional)
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS, TLS versions)
```

### 0.5 Security Controls Scan

```
Scan for:
- Input validation (Zod schemas, DOMPurify usage)
- Rate limiting (Upstash, middleware)
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention (DOMPurify, CSP headers)
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries, Supabase client)
- Error handling (Sentry, error boundaries)
- Logging and monitoring
- CI/CD security (dependency audit, type checking, linting)
```

### 0.6 Build Inventory File

Write all findings to `.compliance-docs-reports/inventory.json`:

```json
{
  "project": { "name": "", "company": "", "description": "" },
  "stack": { "framework": "", "database": "", "hosting": "", "cdn": "" },
  "services": [
    { "name": "", "purpose": "", "data_processed": "", "subprocessor": true, "region": "", "compliance_url": "" }
  ],
  "auth": { "provider": "", "methods": [], "session_type": "", "mfa": false, "rls_tables": [] },
  "security_controls": {
    "input_validation": [],
    "rate_limiting": [],
    "xss_prevention": [],
    "encryption": { "at_rest": "", "in_transit": "" },
    "monitoring": [],
    "ci_cd": []
  },
  "data_flows": {
    "collection_points": [],
    "storage_locations": [],
    "external_transfers": []
  }
}
```

## PHASE 1: INTERACTIVE DOCUMENT SELECTION

**This phase is SKIPPED if a --tier or --doc flag was provided.**

### 1.1 Present Scan Summary

Display a brief summary of what was found:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CODEBASE SECURITY SCAN COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Project: Rowan (Steel Motion LLC)

Third-party services detected: 7
Auth: Supabase Auth (email + OAuth)
RLS-protected tables: 14
Security controls: Input validation, rate limiting, XSS prevention
CI/CD: GitHub Actions (lint, build, security audit)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 1.2 Present Document Menu

Use AskUserQuestion to present the tiered menu:

**Question**: "Which compliance documents would you like to generate?"

Present tiers with descriptions. Allow multi-select. Include options:
- Tier 1 — Essentials (5 docs) — Recommended for first enterprise conversations
- Tier 2 — Common Requests (6 docs) — For active security review processes
- Tier 3 — Enterprise Grade (6 docs) — For large contracts and certification prep
- All documents (17 docs) — Full enterprise package
- Let me pick individually

If user picks "individually", present the full document list as a follow-up multi-select.

### 1.3 Check for Existing Documents

Before generating, check `.compliance-docs-reports/documents/` for existing files:
- If a document exists and is < 30 days old: mark as "current" and skip unless --refresh
- If a document exists and is > 30 days old: mark as "stale" and offer to refresh
- If a document doesn't exist: mark as "missing" and queue for generation

## PHASE 3: VALIDATE

After generating all selected documents:

### 3.1 Cross-Reference Check

```
For each document:
- Verify all claims trace back to scan inventory
- Check internal links between documents are valid
- Ensure consistent terminology across all documents
- Verify dates are current
- Check that company name and project name are consistent
```

### 3.2 Completeness Check

```
For each document:
- All required sections present
- No placeholder text remaining (no "[TBD]" or "[FILL IN]")
- Version and date populated
- Review schedule set
- Revision history initialized
```

### 3.3 Honesty Check

```
CRITICAL: Scan every generated document for claims about controls or capabilities
that were NOT found in the codebase scan. Flag any fabricated claims.

For each unverified claim:
- Mark as "Planned" or "Under Evaluation"
- Add a note in the report that this needs human verification
```

rm -rf .compliance-docs-reports/documents/
echo "Compliance documents removed"
```

## Important Notes

- **NEVER commit these documents** — all output stays in `.compliance-docs-reports/` (gitignored). These are confidential documents shared with enterprise prospects upon request, not public repo content
- **Run quarterly** to keep documents current with codebase changes
- **Always review** generated documents before sharing with customers — AI cannot know business decisions (SLA targets, support hours, contact info)
- **Legal review recommended** for Privacy Policy and Terms of Service before publication
- **Share as PDF** — when sending to prospects, export markdown to PDF for a professional presentation
- **Complements /compliance** — this skill generates documents, /compliance audits code for violations
- **Complements /sec-ship** — this skill documents security posture, /sec-ship finds and fixes vulnerabilities

## RELATED SKILLS

**Feeds from:**
- `/compliance` - compliance audits code for GDPR/CCPA violations; compliance-docs documents the resulting posture
- `/sec-ship` - security hardening produces the controls that compliance-docs describes and certifies

**Feeds into:**
- (none - compliance-docs produces customer-facing documents that are shared out of band, not consumed by other skills)

**Pairs with:**
- `/compliance` - run compliance first to surface and fix code-level violations, then run compliance-docs to document the hardened posture
- `/sec-ship` - run sec-ship to fix vulnerabilities, then compliance-docs to document your security controls for enterprise prospects

**Auto-suggest after completion:**
When Tier 1 documents are generated, suggest: review and fill in human-specific fields (contact info, SLA targets), then export as PDF for prospect sharing

## SITREP

> Reference: [SITREP Standard](~/.claude/standards/SITREP_FORMAT.md)

At the end of every /compliance-docs run, output:

**Skill:** /compliance-docs
**Status:** COMPLETE / PARTIAL / BLOCKED
**Documents generated:** [count and names]
**Compliance frameworks covered:** [list]
**Gaps identified:** [count]
**Files created:** [list with paths]
**Fabricated claims:** none (all grounded in code analysis)

---

## CLEANUP PROTOCOL

> Reference: [Resource Cleanup Protocol](~/.claude/standards/CLEANUP_PROTOCOL.md)

### Compliance-Docs-Specific Cleanup

Cleanup actions:
1. **Gitignore enforcement:** Ensure `.compliance-docs-reports/` is in `.gitignore` — generated documents are confidential
2. **No other resources created** — this skill generates documentation files only
